var x = 10
var y = 20
var result = x + y $ Add x and y $
B: h1: | style: must(1: #6278 2:#2827) | click: on-time | $ This is a comment $
C: body: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
D: messages: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
Runner: A 1,2,3 | B 1,2,3 | C 1,2,3 | D 1,2,3 |
``
